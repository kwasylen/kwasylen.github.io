                     <h1><strong>Orcas</strong></h1>                   
  <p>Otherwise known as <em>Killer Whales!</em>
                     
                     Ever since I saw <em>Free Willy</em> as a child, I have been fascinated by these beautiful mammals. 
                     I was lucky enough to go on a whale watching tour when I lived in Vancouver.
                     We saw a pod of the Transient Orcas that live off the west coast of Canada and the United States.
                     They were feeding at the time we saw them, so we had to stay a ways back.
                     Nethertheless, it was one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life.
                     They're majestic animals that need our help in preserving the seas. </p>
